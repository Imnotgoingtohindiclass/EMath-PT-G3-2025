Post-Hoc Tests for ANOVA

1. University Comparisons:
   - Red cells in the heatmap indicate pairs of universities with statistically significant differences in employment rates (p < 0.05)
   - The most significant differences are between:
     * Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University (p = 0.000000)
     * National University of Singapore and Singapore Management University (p = 0.000000)
     * Singapore Institute of Technology and Singapore Management University (p = 0.000002)

2. Degree Category Comparisons:
   - Red cells in the heatmap indicate pairs of degree categories with statistically significant differences in employment rates (p < 0.05)
   - The most significant differences are between:
     * Engineering and Medicine & Health (p = 0.000000)
     * Arts & Social Sciences and Medicine & Health (p = 0.000000)
     * Medicine & Health and Other (p = 0.000000)

3. Key Insights:
   - These post-hoc tests reveal exactly which universities and degree programs differ significantly
   - This provides actionable insights for students choosing between specific universities or degree programs
   - The results show which educational choices lead to statistically different employment outcomes
