Multiple Regression Analysis: Factor Importance

1. Model Comparison:
   - Model 1 (Employment Rate Only): R² = 0.1290, Adj. R² = 0.1270
   - Model 2 (Empl. Rate + University): R² = 0.2170, Adj. R² = 0.1980
   - Model 3 (Empl. Rate + Degree): R² = 0.2830, Adj. R² = 0.2650
   - Model 4 (Empl. Rate + Univ. + Degree): R² = 0.3420, Adj. R² = 0.3100

2. Incremental Contribution:
   - University adds 0.0880 to R² beyond Employment Rate alone
   - Degree adds 0.1540 to R² beyond Employment Rate alone
   - University and Degree together add 0.2130 to R² beyond Employment Rate alone

3. Relative Importance:
   - Degree has a stronger effect than University on salary outcomes
   - The combined effect of both factors explains 0.2130 of the variance in salary

4. Key Insights:
   - This analysis quantifies how much university choice and degree choice each contribute to salary differences
   - Both factors are important predictors of salary
   - Degree choice appears to have a stronger influence on salary outcomes than university choice
   - The model comparison shows which factors should be prioritized when making educational choices
