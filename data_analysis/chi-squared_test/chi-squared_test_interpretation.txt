Chi-Square Test Analysis Interpretation:

1. University vs Employment Rate:
   - Null Hypothesis: There is no relationship between university choice and employment rate
   - P-value: 0.0000
   - Interpretation: Reject the null hypothesis (p < 0.05)
   - Key Finding: There is a significant relationship between university choice and employment rate

2. Degree Category vs Employment Rate:
   - Null Hypothesis: There is no relationship between degree category and employment rate
   - P-value: 0.0000
   - Interpretation: Reject the null hypothesis (p < 0.05)
   - Key Finding: There is a significant relationship between degree category and employment rate

3. Overall Conclusions:
   - Both university choice and degree category show similar patterns in relation to employment rates
   - The heatmaps visualize the frequency distribution of employment rates across different universities and degree categories
   - Darker colors in the heatmap indicate higher frequencies of observations in those categories
